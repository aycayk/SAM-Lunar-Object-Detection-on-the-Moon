# SAM-Lunar-Object-Detection-on-the-Moon
This project explores the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its LoRA-adapted version for object segmentation on lunar surface images. Using the Artificial Lunar Landscape Dataset, the model is trained to detect and segment objects from both artificially generated and real Moon images.
